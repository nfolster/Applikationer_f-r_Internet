                But what is a recipe? A recipe is a set of instructions that
                describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary dish. It is also used in 
                medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe, usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol.
